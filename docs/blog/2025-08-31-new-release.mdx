[Caiz.dev](https://caiz.dev/) has launched its initial release. Caiz.dev is building a new developer community focused on the AI era.

{/* truncate */}

Caiz.dev is based on [NodeBB](https://nodebb.org/). The core system remains untouched, with customization achieved solely through plugins and themes. Plugins and themes are primarily developed using vibecoding. Vibe-coding utilizes Claude Code and Codex.

Caiz means “nautical chart(Kaizu)” in Japanese. We want Caiz.dev to be a presence that supports developers setting sail and propels their growth.
